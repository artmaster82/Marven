## External Use
Use of this code outside of the Gamer's Conglomerate is not intended - nor supported, and will result in multiple crashes out-of-the-box. I hold no responsibility for anything that happens as a result of executing this code yourself. If you are after a bot of your own, please look for a public bot, or ask me for a private one made for you.
